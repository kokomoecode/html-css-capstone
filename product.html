                The 2020/21 UEFA Champions League final will be held at Istanbul's Atatürk Olympic Stadium – a legendary
                venue in Liverpool lore – on Saturday 29 May, with English winners assured again as Manchester City take
                on Chelsea.

              <h3>
                "The Reds completed "the greatest comeback in sport anywhere in the world" to defy the odds
                and win the European Cup against AC Milan"
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Champions League final of 2005 will forever be remembered as one of the all-time great games in the
                history of football,
                but especially in Liverpool as the Reds managed to win their fifth European Cup in the unlikeliest of
                circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                AC Milan travelled to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul as strong favourites to win the trophy
                against an outfit that had finished fifth in the Premier League.
                The Italians’ status appeared entirely justified as they raced into a 3-0 half-time advantage thank to
                goals from Paolo Maldini and Hernan Crespo, who scored twice.
              </p>
              <p>
                In one of the most remarkable turnarounds in history, though, the Reds came roaring back into the game
                in
                the second half, scoring three times in the space of six minutes.
                Steven Gerrard, whose dynamic performance won him the Man of the Match accolade, got the first back and
                as
                the Serie A side uncharacteristically wobbled, Vladimir Smicer
                and Xabi Alonso took advantage to draw the Anfield club back on terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                The penalty shootout was also a memorable affair, with Milan missing their first two kicks through
                Serginho and the normally reliable Andrea Pirlo. Liverpool raced into a 2-0 lead but John Arne Riise had
                his effort saved by Dida after Jon Dahl Tomasson had got one back. Kaka and Smicer exchanged goals but
                the
                cup was sealed when Andriy Shevchenko, then regarded as the finest centre-forward in the world, had his
                kick stopped by Jerzy Dudek.
              </p>

              <p>
                Liverpool’s victory was greeted with astonishment, notably from manager Rafael Benitez, who admitted at
                the conclusion of the match: “My problem is that I don't have words to express the things that I feel at
                this moment.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Television pundit and former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen said: “It wasn’t just the best comeback in a
                European Cup final; it wasn’t just the best comeback I’ve seen in football; it was the best comeback
                I’ve
                seen in sport anywhere in the world.”
              </p>
              <p>
                No less a figure that Diego Maradona was similarly awestruck: “Even the Brazil team that won the 1970
                World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that
                miracles
                really do exist.”
              </p>
              <p>
                From the other side of the fence, there was an equally profound reaction, as Pirlo explained in his
                autobiography ‘I Think Therefore I Play’: “We sat like a bunch of half-wits in the dressing room… We
                were
                bloodthirsty zombies faced with an unseen problem – the blood was ours and they had drunk every last
                drop.
                We couldn’t speak, we couldn’t move. They had mentally destroyed us. Insomnia, rage, depression, a sense
                of nothingness. We’d invented a new disease with multiple symptoms: Istanbul syndrome.”
