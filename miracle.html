              The 2020/21 UEFA Champions League final will be held at Istanbul's Atatürk Olympic Stadium – a legendary
              venue in Liverpool lore – on Saturday 29 May, with English winners assured again as Manchester City take
              on Chelsea.

            <h3>
              "The Reds completed "the greatest comeback in sport anywhere in the world" to defy the odds
              and win the European Cup against AC Milan"
            </h3>
            <p>
              The Champions League final of 2005 will forever be remembered as one of the all-time great games in the
              history of football,
              but especially in Liverpool as the Reds managed to win their fifth European Cup in the unlikeliest of
              circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
              AC Milan travelled to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul as strong favourites to win the trophy
              against an outfit that had finished fifth in the Premier League.
              The Italians’ status appeared entirely justified as they raced into a 3-0 half-time advantage thank to
              goals from Paolo Maldini and Hernan Crespo, who scored twice.
            </p>
            <p>
              In one of the most remarkable turnarounds in history, though, the Reds came roaring back into the game in
              the second half, scoring three times in the space of six minutes.
              Steven Gerrard, whose dynamic performance won him the Man of the Match accolade, got the first back and as
              the Serie A side uncharacteristically wobbled, Vladimir Smicer
              and Xabi Alonso took advantage to draw the Anfield club back on terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The penalty shootout was also a memorable affair, with Milan missing their first two kicks through
              Serginho and the normally reliable Andrea Pirlo. Liverpool raced into a 2-0 lead but John Arne Riise had
              his effort saved by Dida after Jon Dahl Tomasson had got one back. Kaka and Smicer exchanged goals but the
              cup was sealed when Andriy Shevchenko, then regarded as the finest centre-forward in the world, had his
              kick stopped by Jerzy Dudek.
            </p>

            <p>
              Liverpool’s victory was greeted with astonishment, notably from manager Rafael Benitez, who admitted at
              the conclusion of the match: “My problem is that I don't have words to express the things that I feel at
              this moment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Television pundit and former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen said: “It wasn’t just the best comeback in a
              European Cup final; it wasn’t just the best comeback I’ve seen in football; it was the best comeback I’ve
              seen in sport anywhere in the world.”
            </p>
            <p>
              No less a figure that Diego Maradona was similarly awestruck: “Even the Brazil team that won the 1970
              World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that miracles
              really do exist.”
            </p>
            <p>
              From the other side of the fence, there was an equally profound reaction, as Pirlo explained in his
              autobiography ‘I Think Therefore I Play’: “We sat like a bunch of half-wits in the dressing room… We were
              bloodthirsty zombies faced with an unseen problem – the blood was ours and they had drunk every last drop.
              We couldn’t speak, we couldn’t move. They had mentally destroyed us. Insomnia, rage, depression, a sense
              of nothingness. We’d invented a new disease with multiple symptoms: Istanbul syndrome.”
